## Growing Platform Vision
This project is evolving from simple API to comprehensive platform:
- **Current**: Databricks API wrapper with SQL/Jobs/Clusters
- **Near-term**: Streaming, caching, advanced analytics
- **Long-term**: ML platform, multi-tenant architecture, enterprise features

Every change should consider this growth trajectory and maintain high quality standards.

## ABSOLUTE RULE ENFORCEMENT

### üö® CRITICAL: ALL RULES ARE MANDATORY üö®

**BEFORE making ANY change:**
1. **MUST** review local/docs/CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_STATUS.md
2. **MUST** understand current project context
3. **MUST** ensure change aligns with project direction

**DURING development:**
1. **MUST** follow all coding standards absolutely
2. **MUST** create required architecture diagrams
3. **MUST** implement comprehensive testing
4. **MUST** maintain security standards

**AFTER making ANY change:**
1. **MUST** update local/docs/CHANGELOG.md immediately
2. **MUST** update PROJECT_STATUS.md
3. **MUST** complete all checklist items
4. **MUST** document impact and dependencies

### Failure to Follow Rules
**Failure to follow ANY rule will result in:**
- Loss of project context and direction
- Quality degradation and technical debt
- Security vulnerabilities
- Deployment and maintenance issues
- **Immediate requirement to fix and document properly**

**These rules exist to maintain excellence as the platform scales.**
