    3. ✅ **Improve Tests**: Mocked `BinanceClient` for speed and reliability.
    4. ✅ **Refine Architecture**: Resolved circular dependencies and magic strings.

## Recent Changes
- **Phase 1.5**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Enhanced foundational quality and performance
- **Phase 1.4**: Implemented the Signal Generation Engine using Polars.
- **Phase 1.3**: Finalized and stabilized the Market Data Pipeline.
- **Phase 1.2**: Established robust database and Redis connections.

## Known Issues
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Integration tests now use mocked BinanceClient for speed
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Database inserts now use efficient batch executemany operations
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Architectural improvements - eliminated circular dependencies and magic strings
- No critical issues blocking Phase 2 development
