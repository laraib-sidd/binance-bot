# Project Status - 2024-08-01

## Current Version
- **Version**: 1.5.0 (In Development)
- **Last Stable Release**: 1.4.0
- **Development Status**: Active

## Current Focus
- **Phase 1.5: Foundational Improvements**
  - **Primary Goal**: Enhance project quality, performance, and maintainability.
  - **Tasks**:
    1.  **Automate Rules**: Implement `pre-commit` hooks for `black` and `ruff`.
    2.  **Optimize DB Inserts**: Refactor to use batch `executemany`.
    3.  **Improve Tests**: Mock `BinanceClient` for speed and reliability.
    4.  **Refine Architecture**: Resolve circular dependencies and magic strings.

## Recent Changes
- **Phase 1.4**: Implemented the Signal Generation Engine using Polars.
- **Phase 1.3**: Finalized and stabilized the Market Data Pipeline.
- **Phase 1.2**: Established robust database and Redis connections.

## Known Issues
- Integration tests are slow due to live network calls (to be fixed in this phase).
- Database inserts for historical data are inefficient (to be fixed in this phase).
- Minor architectural "code smells" like circular dependencies and magic strings (to be fixed in this phase).

- **Medium Risk**: Financial software requires extensive testing and validation

### Financial Risks
- **High Risk**: Target returns carry significant risk of loss
- **Mitigated**: Comprehensive risk management framework defined
- **Controlled**: Paper trading mandatory before live deployment

### Technical Risks
- **Low Risk**: Well-defined architecture and clear technology stack
- **Medium Risk**: Real-time trading system complexity
- **Low Risk**: Strong development practices and testing requirements

## Next Steps
