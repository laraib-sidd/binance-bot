## üéØ Purpose
Establish comprehensive project structure and development rules framework for Helios Trading Bot. This PR transforms the project from a collection of documentation files into a properly organized, scalable trading bot development environment with mandatory change tracking and security standards.

## üîÑ Changes
- **Added**: Complete project directory structure with source packages, testing framework, and documentation organization
- **Added**: Trading bot specific development rules (010-trading-bot-specific.mdc) with financial safety standards
- **Added**: Comprehensive security rules (003-security.mdc) for financial application development
- **Added**: Mandatory change tracking system (CHANGELOG.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md)
- **Modified**: Updated main rules framework from Databricks API context to cryptocurrency trading bot
- **Enhanced**: .gitignore with local/ directory protection and enhanced security patterns

## üß™ Testing
- [x] Directory structure created successfully
- [x] All package __init__.py files added
- [x] .gitignore properly excludes local/ directory
- [x] CHANGELOG.md follows proper format and includes all changes
- [x] PROJECT_STATUS.md accurately reflects current project state
- [x] Updated rules are consistent and complete
- [x] Mermaid diagrams render correctly

## üìö Usage

### Directory Structure Usage
```python
# Proper import structure now possible
from src.core.trading_engine import TradingEngine
from src.strategies.dynamic_grid import DynamicGridStrategy
from src.risk.risk_manager import RiskManager

# Test organization
# tests/unit/test_risk_manager.py
# tests/integration/test_trading_flow.py
# tests/backtest/test_strategy_performance.py
```

### Change Tracking Usage
```bash
# Before making any changes (MANDATORY)
cat local/docs/CHANGELOG.md | head -20
cat PROJECT_STATUS.md

# After making changes (MANDATORY)
# Update local/docs/CHANGELOG.md with detailed change description
# Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with current state
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/add-signal-engine

# 2. Review current status (MANDATORY)
cat local/docs/CHANGELOG.md
cat PROJECT_STATUS.md

# 3. Make changes following rules
# 4. Update documentation (MANDATORY)
# 5. Run tests
pytest tests/

# 6. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: implement signal analysis engine with ATR-based volatility detection"
```
