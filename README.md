# Helios Trading Bot Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the design and implementation plan for **Helios**, an aggressive-growth cryptocurrency trading bot built from scratch in Python. The bot implements a unique **Signal-Driven Dynamic Grid Trading** strategy designed to generate steady weekly income through high-frequency automated trading.

## Conversation Summary

This project emerged from a comprehensive analysis of trading bot strategies and requirements. Key highlights:

- **Goal**: Build a profitable crypto trading bot for aggressive growth (30-40% monthly returns target)
- **Capital**: Starting with $700 
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate trader with Python/Data Engineering background
- **Strategy**: Custom hybrid approach combining signal analysis with dynamic grid trading
- **Market Focus**: High-volume altcoins for maximum volatility and profit potential

## Project Components

### üìã Documentation Files
- `requirements_analysis.md` - Detailed Q&A session defining project requirements
- `strategy_analysis.md` - In-depth comparison of different trading strategies
- `design_document.md` - Complete technical specification for the Helios bot
- `risk_management.md` - Comprehensive risk management framework
- `development_roadmap.md` - Step-by-step implementation timeline

### üöÄ Key Features
