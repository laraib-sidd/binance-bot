- **Performance Issues**: Profile code and optimize critical paths
- **Integration Problems**: Extensive testing at each phase

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to core features for v1.0
- **Complex Debugging**: Allocate 20% buffer time for each phase
- **Learning Curve**: Focus on proven patterns and libraries
- **Testing Time**: Parallel development and testing

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Reviews**: Self-review all critical components
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests + integration tests + end-to-end tests
- **Documentation**: Document as you code, not after
- **Version Control**: Commit frequently with clear messages
