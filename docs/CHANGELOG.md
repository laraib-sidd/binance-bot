## [Unreleased] - Current Development

### 🚀 Phase 1.6 - Regime Gating, Schema Fixes, CI (2025-01-10)
- Added regime-aware gating in `SignalGenerator` using a lightweight ADX proxy (`adx_threshold` configurable). Grid/entries disabled during strong trend regimes.
- Fixed logging initialization in `src/main.py` to pass full `TradingConfig` to logging setup.
- Enforced configurable database schema usage throughout `market_data_pipeline.py` (no more hardcoded `helios_trading`).
- Repaired database verification and stats queries in `src/data/database_schema.py` (correct f-string in table_type filter; simplified stats query to avoid placeholder mismatch).
- Aligned versions: bumped `pyproject.toml` to `1.5.0`; updated mypy target to Python 3.11; removed Python 3.9 classifier.
- Disabled broken backtest CLI entry until implemented.
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with black/ruff/mypy/pytest hooks; added GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) to run lint, type checks, and tests.
- CI fix: ensure `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`, and `pytest` run inside uv-managed environment using `astral-sh/setup-uv@v3` and `uv run` to avoid "command not found" errors.
- Documentation: to follow with API docs and user guides in Phase 1.6 docs task.

**Note**: This changelog follows the mandatory change tracking rules defined in `.cursor/rules/008-change-tracking-mandatory.mdc`

## [Unreleased] - Current Development

### Added
- **Automated Tooling**: Configured `pre-commit` hooks with `black` for automated code formatting and `ruff` for high-performance linting to enforce code quality standards automatically.
- **Centralized Constants**: Introduced a constants module to manage database table names, Redis key prefixes, and other magic strings, improving maintainability and reducing errors.

### Changed
- **Performance**: Refactored the historical data storage method (`_store_ohlcv_data`) to use a single, efficient batch `executemany` operation, drastically reducing database round-trips when ingesting large datasets.
- **Testing**: Overhauled integration tests by mocking the `BinanceClient`. This makes the test suite significantly faster, completely reliable, and independent of network conditions or API keys.
- **Architecture**: Resolved a circular dependency between `MarketDataPipeline` and the `ConnectionManager` by refactoring the application lifecycle management.
