## üö® **Usage Alerts & Thresholds**

### **Warning Thresholds (Take Action)**
```python
WARNING_THRESHOLDS = {
    "neon_storage": "8GB (80% of 10GB limit)",
    "neon_compute": "80 hours (80% of 100 hours/month)",
    "upstash_memory": "200MB (78% of 256MB limit)",
    "upstash_bandwidth": "8GB (80% of 10GB/month)",
    "r2_storage": "8GB (80% of 10GB/month)",
    "r2_operations": "800K writes (80% of 1M/month)"
}
```

### **Critical Thresholds (Emergency Action)**
```python
CRITICAL_THRESHOLDS = {
    "neon_storage": "9.5GB (95% of limit)",
    "neon_compute": "95 hours (95% of limit)",
    "upstash_memory": "240MB (94% of limit)", 
    "upstash_bandwidth": "9.5GB (95% of limit)",
    "r2_storage": "9.5GB (95% of limit)"
}
```

### **Mitigation Strategies**
```python
MITIGATION_ACTIONS = {
    "neon_storage_high": [
        "Archive old market data to R2",
        "Compress OHLCV data",
        "Remove duplicate records"
    ],
    "neon_compute_high": [
        "Optimize query efficiency", 
        "Reduce connection pool size",
        "Cache frequent queries in Redis"
    ],
    "upstash_memory_high": [
        "Reduce TTL values",
        "Remove old cache entries",

## üí∞ **Cost Optimization Tracking**

### **Current Monthly Cost**: $0.00 ‚úÖ
```python
COST_BREAKDOWN = {
    "neon_postgresql": "$0.00 (Free tier)",
    "upstash_redis": "$0.00 (Free tier)", 
    "cloudflare_r2": "$0.00 (Free tier)",
    "total_monthly": "$0.00"
}
```

### **Upgrade Cost Analysis** (If Needed)
```python
UPGRADE_COSTS = {
    "neon_pro": "$19/month (50GB storage, 1000 compute hours)",
    "upstash_pro": "$10/month (1GB memory, 100GB bandwidth)",
    "r2_storage": "$0.015/GB/month (beyond 10GB)",
    "estimated_pro_total": "$30-40/month at scale"
}
```

## üìä **Usage Tracking Implementation**

### **Monitoring Scripts** (To Be Implemented)
```python
# File: scripts/monitor_usage.py
class UsageMonitor:
    def check_neon_usage(self):
        """Query Neon API for storage/compute usage"""
        
    def check_upstash_usage(self):
        """Query Upstash API for memory/bandwidth usage"""
        
    def check_r2_usage(self):
        """Query Cloudflare API for storage/operations usage"""
        
    def generate_usage_report(self):
        """Generate daily usage report"""
        
    def check_thresholds(self):
        """Alert if approaching limits"""
```

### **Usage Dashboard** (Future Enhancement)
```python
# Simple dashboard showing:
DASHBOARD_METRICS = {
    "current_usage_percentages": "All services",
    "monthly_trends": "Growth patterns",
    "cost_projections": "If usage continues",
    "optimization_suggestions": "Automated recommendations"
}
```

## üéØ **Scaling Strategy**

### **Growth Milestones**
```python
SCALING_MILESTONES = {
    "milestone_1": {
        "trigger": "80% of any free tier limit",
        "action": "Implement usage optimizations"
    },
    "milestone_2": {
        "trigger": "Consistent 90%+ usage",
        "action": "Plan paid tier upgrades"
    },
    "milestone_3": {
        "trigger": "$700+ monthly revenue from bot",
        "action": "Upgrade to paid plans for reliability"
    }
}
```

### **Service Priority for Upgrades**
```python
UPGRADE_PRIORITY = [
    "1. Upstash Redis (most critical for trading performance)",
    "2. Neon PostgreSQL (storage and compute reliability)",
    "3. Cloudflare R2 (least critical, ample free tier)"
]
```
